# Atom Cura Configuration

Cura has radically changed its configuration format in 2016, making it
incompatible with previous version.

This repository contains a port of [Atom's original Cura
configuration](http://www.atom3dp.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/06/CURA_ATOMSettings_r3.zip)
to the new format.

## How to install?

Make sure `cura` is available in your `$PATH`.

```
make install
```
